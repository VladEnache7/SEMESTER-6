### 2.2. Component Breakdown

The system is broadly divided into Frontend, Backend, and Messaging Layer components.

#### 2.2.1. Frontend

*   **Client:** The user-facing React application (Turbo Bassoon).
    *   **Function:** Initiates HTTP requests to the backend for:
        *   Standard news queries (`/api/prompt`).
        *   Satirical content queries (`/api/satirical-prompt`).
        *   Submitting user feedback (`/api/feedback`).
        *   System health checks (`/api/health`).
        *   Managing system prompts (`/api/system-prompts`).

#### 2.2.2. Backend

Built using FastAPI, orchestrating diverse RAG pipelines and services.

*   **FastAPI App:** Central application server exposing API endpoints:
    *   **`POST /api/prompt`:** Handles user queries for standard news, requiring RAG processing via the `LLM Service`.
    *   **`POST /api/satirical-prompt`:** Handles user queries for satirical content, engaging the `Satirical LLM Service`.
    *   **`POST /api/feedback`:** Receives user feedback (e.g., likes/dislikes), which is then typically published to the `Kafka Broker` for asynchronous processing.
    *   **`GET /api/system-prompts`:** Manages (CRUD) system-level prompts via the `Prompt Service`.
    *   **`GET /api/health`:** Provides a health check, potentially interacting with the `Config Service`.

*   **Core Services:**
    *   **`LLM Service`:** The brain for the standard news RAG pipeline.
        *   **Function:** Takes a user prompt, fetches relevant documents from the `Articles Collection` in Qdrant, and prompts an `Ollama LLM` with the original query and retrieved context to generate a factual response.
        *   **Interactions:** `FastAPI App`, `Vector Store (Articles Collection)`, `Ollama LLM`, `Prompt Service` (for system prompts), `Config Service`.
    *   **`Satirical LLM Service`:** Dedicated service for generating satirical content.
        *   **Function:** Handles requests from `/api/satirical-prompt`. It retrieves relevant satirical articles/context from the `Satirical Articles Collection` in Qdrant, constructs prompts using specialized strategies, and interacts with an `Ollama LLM` (potentially a different model or configuration optimized for creative/satirical text). May operate asynchronously with Kafka.
        *   **Interactions:** `FastAPI App`, `Vector Store (Satirical Articles Collection)`, `Ollama LLM`, `Kafka Service` (for async tasks), `Prompt Service`, `Config Service`.
    *   **`Prompt Service`:** Manages prompt engineering and user feedback lifecycle.
        *   **Function:**
            *   Handles CRUD operations for the `System Prompts Table` in PostgreSQL.
            *   Processes structured user feedback (likes/dislikes from `/api/feedback`, likely received via Kafka) and stores it in PostgreSQL. This feedback is crucial for iterative improvement of prompt strategies or model fine-tuning.
            *   Provides prompts to both `LLM Service` and `Satirical LLM Service`.
        *   **Interactions:** `FastAPI App`, `LLM Service`, `Satirical LLM Service`, `Database (PostgreSQL)`, `Kafka Service` (for consuming feedback events), `Config Service`.
    *   **`Kafka Service`:** Facilitates event-driven communication and asynchronous processing.
        *   **Function:** Acts as a producer and consumer for Kafka topics. Publishes events (e.g., new feedback received) and consumes events for tasks like processing feedback by the `Prompt Service` or managing asynchronous generation by the `Satirical LLM Service`.
        *   **Interactions:** `FastAPI App` (publishing feedback), `Prompt Service` (consuming feedback), `Satirical LLM Service` (consuming generation tasks, publishing results), `Kafka Broker`, `Config Service`.
    *   **`Config Service`:** Centralized configuration management.
        *   **Function:** Provides configuration settings (e.g., API keys, model parameters, Kafka topics, feature flags) to all backend services.
        *   **Why:** Separates configuration from code, simplifying management across different environments.
        *   **Interactions:** All other Core Services, `FastAPI App`.

*   **Vector Store (Qdrant):**
    *   **`Articles Collection`:** Stores vector embeddings of standard news articles for factual RAG.
    *   **`Satirical Articles Collection`:** Stores vector embeddings of curated satirical content for humorous RAG.
    *   **Function:** Enables efficient semantic similarity search for retrieving relevant context for both factual and satirical queries.
    *   **Why Qdrant:** Specialized for fast, scalable similarity searches on large vector datasets.

*   **Database (Relational - PostgreSQL):**
    *   **`System Prompts Table`:** Stores predefined system prompts for guiding LLM behavior.
    *   **`likes/dislikes Table`:** Stores structured user feedback on generated responses.
    *   **Why PostgreSQL:** Robust, open-source RDBMS for structured data, ensuring data integrity.

*   **External AI Models & Tools:**
    *   **`Ollama LLM`:** Serves Large Language Models (e.g., "mistral"). Used by both `LLM Service` and `Satirical LLM Service`, potentially with different models or configurations tailored to the task (factual vs. satirical).
        *   **Why Ollama:** Enables local/self-hosted deployment of open-source LLMs for control, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy.
    *   **`Embedding Model (e.g., from Hugging Face)`:** (Implicitly used) Models like `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` are used to convert text (articles and user queries) into vector embeddings for storage and search in Qdrant.
        *   **Why Hugging Face Models:** Access to a wide array of high-quality pre-trained embedding models.

#### 2.2.3. Messaging Layer

*   **`Kafka Broker`:** The central message bus for the event-driven aspects of the architecture.
    *   **Function:** Receives messages (events) from producers (e.g., `FastAPI App` upon feedback submission, `Kafka Service`) and delivers them to consumers (e.g., `Kafka Service` for `Prompt Service` or `Satirical LLM Service`).
    *   **Why Kafka:** Enables decoupling of services, asynchronous processing, improved fault tolerance, and scalability for real-time data streams.

### 2.3. Key Workflows

#### 2.3.1. Standard News Query Workflow (`/api/prompt`)

1.  **Request:** Client sends a query to `/api/prompt`.
2.  **Routing:** FastAPI routes to `LLM Service`.
3.  **Embedding:** Query is converted to a vector embedding.
4.  **Retrieval:** `LLM Service` queries `Articles Collection` in Qdrant for relevant articles.
5.  **Augmentation & Generation:** Retrieved context + original query (and system prompt from `Prompt Service`) are sent to an `Ollama LLM`.
6.  **Response:** LLM generates a factual response; metadata is extracted.
7.  **Return:** Response and sources are returned to the Client.

#### 2.3.2. Satirical Content Query Workflow (`/api/satirical-prompt`)

1.  **Request:** Client sends a query to `/api/satirical-prompt`.
2.  **Routing:** FastAPI routes to `Satirical LLM Service`.
3.  **Embedding:** Query is converted to a vector embedding.
4.  **Retrieval:** `Satirical LLM Service` queries `Satirical Articles Collection` in Qdrant.
5.  **Prompting & Generation (potentially asynchronous via Kafka):**
    *   Retrieved satirical context + query (and specialized system prompt) are sent to an `Ollama LLM` (optimized for satire).
    *   If asynchronous: Task might be published to Kafka by `Satirical LLM Service`, processed by a worker consuming from Kafka, then result sent back or notified.
6.  **Response:** LLM generates a satirical response.
7.  **Return:** Satirical response is returned to the Client.

#### 2.3.3. User Feedback Workflow (`/api/feedback`)

1.  **Request:** Client submits feedback (e.g., like/dislike) to `/api/feedback`.
2.  **Publish Event:** FastAPI (or `Kafka Service` directly) publishes a feedback event to a specific topic in `Kafka Broker`.
3.  **Consume Event:** `Kafka Service` consumes the feedback event.
4.  **Process & Store:** The consumed event is passed to the `Prompt Service`, which processes the feedback (e.g., aggregates ratings) and stores it in the `likes/dislikes` table in PostgreSQL.
5.  **Future Improvement:** This stored feedback can be used for analyzing response quality, refining prompts, or even fine-tuning models.

### 2.4. Why This Enhanced Architecture is Effective

*   **Specialized Content Handling:** Dedicated services and data stores for factual vs. satirical content ensure appropriate tone, context, and quality for diverse user needs.
*   **Improved Responsiveness & Scalability with Kafka:** Asynchronous processing for feedback and potentially complex generation tasks prevents blocking API calls and allows services to scale independently.
*   **Enhanced Accuracy & Relevance:** RAG grounds LLM responses in curated data, minimizing hallucinations and tailoring outputs.
*   **Robust Feedback Loop:** Structured feedback collection via Kafka and PostgreSQL enables continuous improvement of the system's performance and content quality.
*   **Modularity & Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns into microservices makes the system easier to develop, test, deploy, and maintain.
*   **Flexibility with Models:** Ollama and Hugging Face integration allows for easy experimentation and swapping of LLMs and embedding models.
*   **Control & Customization:** Self-hosting models and managing data provides significant control over the AI pipeline and data privacy.

## 3. Backend Details

### 3.1. Technology Stack

*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Frameworks/Libraries:**
    *   FastAPI (API Management)
    *   LlamaIndex (Core RAG orchestration)
    *   Qdrant Client (Vector database interaction)
    *   HuggingFace Transformers/Sentence-Transformers (Embedding models)
    *   `confluent-kafka-python` or `kafka-python` (Kafka client library)
    *   Puppeteer (via Node.js for Web Scraping - if still applicable for both content types)
    *   Pandas / NumPy (Data Processing)
*   **Databases:**
    *   PostgreSQL (Relational Data: System Prompts, Feedback)
    *   Qdrant (Vector Data: Articles Collection, Satirical Articles Collection)
*   **Messaging:** Apache Kafka (Kafka Broker)
*   **LLM Serving:** Ollama
*   **External LLM Interfaces:** Client libraries for Ollama.

### 3.2. Data Collection & Processing


#### 3.2.1. Article Link Collection
Utilizes a Puppeteer script (`gather-article-links.js`) to scrape article URLs from NBC News archives.
*   **Output:** `nbc.json` (list of article URLs).
```javascript
// Key snippet from gather-article-links.js
import puppeteer from "puppeteer";
import fs from "fs";

const BASE_URL = "https://www.nbcnews.com/archive/articles";
const ARTICLE_TAG = ".MonthPage > a"; // CSS Selector for article links
// ... (rest of the script)
```

#### 3.2.2. Article Content Extraction
A second Puppeteer script (`scrape-article-content.js`) visits each collected URL to extract detailed content.
*   **Output:** `parsed_data_nbc.json` (structured article data). This raw text data is then processed by the **Embedding Model** to create vector embeddings, which are subsequently stored in the **Articles Collection** within **Qdrant**.
```javascript
// Key snippet from scrape-article-content.js
// ...
const title = await page.$(".article-hero-headline__htag");
const paragraphs = await page.$$(".body-graf");
const date = await page.evaluate(() => {
  const metaTag = document.querySelector('meta[property="article:published_time"]');
  return metaTag ? metaTag.getAttribute("content") : null;
});
// ...
```
*Data Structure (per article before embedding):*
```json 
{
  "title": "Article headline text",
  "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/article-path",
  "content": ["Paragraph 1", "Paragraph 2", "..."],
  "date": "2025-04-15T14:30:00Z",
  "type": "factual or satirical"
}
```
